# How to use these

1. Quit Unity
2. Open a terminal and `cd` to this folder
3. Run the appropriate build script. 
   - If you are running Windows, you want `build-*-on-win.bat`
   - If you are running macOS, you want `./build-*-on-mac.sh`
   - If you are running Linux, why? 
4. The built game will be located in `build/platformname/`. You do not need to delete `build` to make another build for a different platform. 

It's as shrimple as that!
